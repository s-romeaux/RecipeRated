# JSZ's Recipe Vault

Milestone Project #3 for UNLV Software Development Bootcamp

When asked to create a program for everything we have learned so far, Johnson, Sal, and Zach came up with the Recipe Vault, a website where people can share recipes with each other.

## App Description

Users can share information about recipes such as the ingredients, the time it takes, step by step instructions, and even their inspiration for their dish!
